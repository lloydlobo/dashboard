## Development

### Profiling - Timings

> The --timings option gives some information about how long each compilation takes, and tracks concurrency information over time.
> This writes an HTML report in target/cargo-timings/cargo-timing.html. This also writes a copy of the report to the same directory with a timestamp in the filename, if you want to look at older runs.

```sh
$ cargo build --release --bin dashboard --timings --help
$ miniserve target/cargo-timings/cargo-timing.html
miniserve v0.22.0
Bound to [::]:8080, 0.0.0.0:8080
Serving path /target/cargo-timings
Available at (non-exhaustive list):

> "Waiting" (red) ‚Äî This is the number of units waiting for a CPU slot to open.
> "Inactive" (blue) ‚Äî This is the number of units that are waiting for their dependencies to finish.
> "Active" (green) ‚Äî This is the number of units currently running.
>
> Tips for addressing compile times:
>
> - Look for slow dependencies.
> - Check if they have features that you may wish to consider disabling.
> - Consider trying to remove the dependency completely.
> - Look for a crate being built multiple times with different versions. Try to remove the older versions from the dependency graph.
> - Split large crates into smaller pieces.
> - If there are a large number of crates bottlenecked on a single crate, focus your attention on improving that one crate to improve parallelism.
